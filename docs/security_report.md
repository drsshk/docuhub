- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to version 23.0.0 or higher.

### Django Settings Audit

#### SECRET_KEY
- **Finding:** The `SECRET_KEY` is loaded from environment variables.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is a good practice as it prevents the key from being hardcoded in the codebase.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure the `SECRET_KEY` is a long, random, and complex string, and that it is securely managed in the production environment (e.g., using a secrets management service).

#### DEBUG
- **Finding:** The `DEBUG` setting is loaded from environment variables, defaulting to `False`.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This correctly sets `DEBUG` to `False` by default in production, which is crucial for security.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure `DEBUG` is always `False` in production environments. Running with `DEBUG=True` in production can expose sensitive information and lead to other vulnerabilities.

#### ALLOWED_HOSTS
- **Finding:** In `DEBUG` mode, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` includes `0.0.0.0` and a specific IP address `152.42.210.234`.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** While `0.0.0.0` is generally not recommended even in development, it's less critical than in production. The specific IP address might be for a development server. In production, it correctly loads from `config('ALLOWED_HOSTS')`, which is good practice.
- **Recommendation:** In production, ensure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is strictly configured to only include the domain names and IP addresses that your Django application serves. Avoid wildcard `*` or `0.0.0.0` in production.

#### CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- **Finding:** In `DEBUG` mode, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes `http://152.42.210.234` and other localhost origins. `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True` is set globally.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** In production, it correctly loads from `config('CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS')`. Since `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS` is `True`, using broad origins even in development can be risky if not carefully managed.
- **Recommendation:** In production, ensure `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is strictly configured to only include the trusted origins that are allowed to make cross-origin requests. Avoid `*` in production. Since `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS` is `True`, ensure that `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` does not contain `*` and is explicitly set to specific, trusted origins to prevent potential CSRF vulnerabilities.

#### Database Configuration
- **Finding:** Database credentials are loaded from environment variables.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is a good security practice. The use of `dj_database_url.parse` for `DATABASE_URL` also promotes secure handling of database connection strings. `sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'` is set.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that the environment variables storing database credentials are not exposed in version control and are managed securely in production environments (e.g., using a secrets management service). Also, ensure that the database user has only the necessary privileges.

#### Email Configuration
- **Finding:** Email settings are configured differently for `DEBUG` and production.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** In `DEBUG` mode, it uses Brevo SMTP with credentials from `config()`. In production, it uses `smtp.gmail.com` by default, also loading credentials from `config()`. `EMAIL_USE_TLS` is `True` in both cases. `BREVO_API_KEY` and `FRONTEND_URL` are loaded from `config()`.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that email credentials are securely managed. For production, consider using a dedicated transactional email service rather than a generic Gmail SMTP for better deliverability and security. Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` is correctly configured for production.

#### Password Validators
- **Finding:** In `DEBUG` mode, `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` only requires a minimum length of 4 characters.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** This is too weak. In production, a more robust set of validators is used.
- **Recommendation:** For production, the current validators are good. For development, consider increasing the minimum length to at least 8 characters to encourage stronger development passwords.

#### Security Middleware
- **Finding:** The `MIDDLEWARE` list includes `SecurityMiddleware`, `CsrfViewMiddleware`, and `XFrameOptionsMiddleware`. Additional security settings are enabled in production.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** All enabled security middleware and settings are good practices.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure `USE_HTTPS` is set to `True` in production environments where HTTPS is deployed to enable HSTS and secure cookies. Regularly review and update these settings as security best practices evolve.

#### Sentry Configuration
- **Finding:** Sentry is initialized if `SENTRY_DSN` is configured.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** It integrates Django and logging, sets `traces_sample_rate=0.1`, and `send_default_pii=False`.
- **Recommendation:** Loading `SENTRY_DSN` from environment variables is good. Setting `send_default_pii=False` is a good privacy practice. Ensure that `traces_sample_rate` is appropriate for production to avoid excessive data transmission while still capturing relevant errors. Regularly review Sentry's configuration and collected data to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently being sent.

### Hardcoded Credentials

#### Hardcoded Passwords in Test/Sample Data
- **Finding:** Hardcoded passwords were found in `apps/projects/tests.py` (`password='password123'`) and `management/commands/sample_data.py` (`password='testpass123'`, `password='admin123'`).
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** While these are in test/sample data files, it's best practice to avoid hardcoding any credentials, even for testing.
- **Recommendation:** Consider using Django's `User.set_password()` method with randomly generated passwords for test users, or load test credentials from a secure, non-version-controlled configuration file if specific values are needed.

### Application Code Audit

#### `apps/projects/views.py`

##### Authentication and Authorization
- **Finding:** The views generally use `@login_required` and `UserPassesTestMixin` (or `user_passes_test` helper functions) for authentication and authorization.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** `CanEditProject`, `CanCreateNewVersion`, `IsProjectManager`, `IsProjectAdministrator`, and `CanViewProject` permissions are used, indicating a granular permission system.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that all sensitive views are adequately protected and that the custom permission logic (`has_permission` methods) is thoroughly tested to prevent authorization bypasses.

##### CSRF Protection
- **Finding:** `@csrf_protect` is used on POST-handling views.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is a good practice.
- **Recommendation:** Continue to ensure that all views handling state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) are protected by CSRF.

##### Information Disclosure
- **Finding:** Debug print statements are present in `ProjectDetailView`.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** While these are likely for development, they should not be present in production as they can reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings.
- **Recommendation:** Remove or comment out all debug print statements before deploying to production. Use Django's logging framework with appropriate log levels instead.

##### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Finding:** The `add_drawing` and `edit_drawing` functions construct HTML responses with embedded JavaScript using f-strings.
- **Severity:** High
- **Details:** If `drawing.drawing_no` contains malicious input, this could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Recommendation:** When embedding user-controlled data into HTML or JavaScript, always use Django's template filters (e.g., `escapejs`) or other appropriate escaping mechanisms to prevent XSS.

##### Duplicate Code
- **Finding:** The `add_drawing` function is duplicated in the file.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** While not a direct security vulnerability, duplicated code increases the attack surface and makes it harder to maintain and secure the application consistently.
- **Recommendation:** Refactor the duplicated `add_drawing` function into a single, reusable function to improve maintainability and reduce the risk of introducing inconsistencies or missing security fixes.

##### Open Redirect Vulnerability
- **Finding:** The `redirect` function is used in several places.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** If the redirect URL is constructed from user-controlled input without proper validation, it could lead to an open redirect vulnerability.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that all redirect URLs are either hardcoded, derived from trusted sources, or thoroughly validated against a whitelist of allowed domains/paths if they incorporate any user-supplied input.

##### Client IP Address Handling
- **Finding:** The `get_client_ip(request)` function is used to retrieve the client's IP address.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** The implementation of this function (located in `apps/accounts/utils.py`) needs to be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles `X-Forwarded-For` headers and prevents IP spoofing.
- **Recommendation:** Review the `get_client_ip` function in `apps/accounts/utils.py` to ensure it prioritizes trusted proxy headers and falls back to `REMOTE_ADDR` appropriately.

##### Rate Limiting
- **Finding:** Rate limiting decorators (`@ratelimit`) are commented out in several views.
- **Severity:** High
- **Details:** This leaves the application susceptible to brute-force attacks or DoS.
- **Recommendation:** Re-enable and properly configure rate limiting for all views that are susceptible to brute-force attacks or DoS (e.g., login, registration, password reset, and any API endpoints). This is crucial for protecting against automated attacks.

##### SQL Injection (Indirect)
- **Finding:** While Django's ORM generally protects against SQL injection, complex `Q` objects or raw SQL queries (if any are used elsewhere) could introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** The `ProjectListView` uses `Q` objects for filtering and searching.
- **Recommendation:** Review all complex `Q` object constructions and any raw SQL queries (if present in other files) to ensure they are safe from SQL injection.

##### Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs
- **Finding:** The `ProjectDetailView` logs project access by admin users, including `project_name` and `project_group_id`.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** While this is not inherently sensitive, ensure that no truly sensitive project data is logged in plain text.
- **Recommendation:** Regularly review logging configurations and practices to ensure that sensitive data (e.g., PII, financial data, secrets) is not inadvertently logged. Implement data masking or redaction for sensitive fields if necessary.

#### `apps/accounts/views.py`

##### Authentication and Authorization
- **Finding:** Views generally use `@login_required` and `user_passes_test` for access control.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is a good foundation.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that `is_staff_user` and `is_admin_role_user` functions are robust and correctly reflect the intended authorization logic. Thoroughly test all access control mechanisms, especially for admin-only views, to prevent privilege escalation.

##### Password Management
- **Finding:** The `password_reset_request` view generates a temporary password and sends it via email.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** Sending temporary passwords via email is generally discouraged due to the risk of interception.
- **Recommendation:** Consider implementing a password reset flow that uses a secure, one-time link instead of a temporary password sent via email. If temporary passwords must be used, ensure they are short-lived and users are forced to change them upon first login.

##### Session Management
- **Finding:** `UserSession` objects are created upon login.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is good for tracking user sessions.
- **Recommendation:** Implement mechanisms to invalidate sessions upon logout, password change, or suspicious activity. Consider adding session expiry and idle timeouts.

##### Information Disclosure
- **Finding:** The `login_view` exposes `ADMIN_EMAIL` or `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` in its context.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** While this might be intended for support, it could be used by attackers for social engineering or targeted phishing.
- **Recommendation:** Avoid exposing internal email addresses or other potentially sensitive configuration details in publicly accessible views. If a support email is necessary, use a generic, publicly known address.

##### Open Redirect Vulnerability
- **Finding:** The `login_view` uses `request.GET.get('next', 'core:dashboard')` for redirection.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** If `request.GET.get('next')` is not properly validated, it could lead to an open redirect vulnerability.
- **Recommendation:** Always validate the `next` parameter against a whitelist of allowed URLs or ensure it points to an internal path within the application to prevent malicious redirects.

##### Client IP Address Handling
- **Finding:** The `get_client_ip(request)` function is used to retrieve the client's IP address for `UserSession` and other logging.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** The security of this depends on the implementation of `get_client_ip` in `apps/accounts/utils.py`.
- **Recommendation:** Refer to the recommendation for `get_client_ip` in `apps/accounts/utils.py`.

##### API Endpoints
- **Finding:** The `dashboard_stats_api` endpoint provides statistics on users, sessions, and projects.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** It is protected by `@login_required`.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that the data exposed by this API is appropriate for all authenticated users. If certain statistics are only for administrators, implement more granular permission checks (e.g., `user_passes_test(is_admin_role_user)`).

#### `apps/notifications/views.py`

##### Authentication and Authorization
- **Finding:** The `notification_preferences` view is protected by `@login_required`. The `email_logs` and `email_statistics` views are protected by `user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_staff)`.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** Correctly restricts them to staff users.
- **Recommendation:** The authentication and authorization seem appropriate for these views.

##### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Finding:** The `email_logs` view filters logs based on `status`, `template_type`, and `search` parameters from `request.GET`.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** While Django's ORM generally protects against SQL injection, improper handling of `search` queries could lead to vulnerabilities if raw SQL was used or if the `Q` objects were constructed insecurely. The current usage is generally safe against direct SQL injection.
- **Recommendation:** Regularly review how user-supplied input is used in filters and searches to prevent potential injection attacks (e.g., XSS if the search query is reflected unsanitized in the template). Ensure that the `search` parameter is properly escaped when rendered back to the HTML template.

##### Information Disclosure
- **Finding:** The `email_logs` view displays `recipient_email`, `project__project_name`, and `recipient_name`. The `email_statistics` view provides aggregate data.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** This information is restricted to staff users.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that the level of detail provided in email logs and statistics is appropriate for all staff users. If certain email content or recipient details are highly sensitive, consider further restricting access or redacting information.

##### Error Handling
- **Finding:** No explicit error handling for unexpected issues during database queries or data processing is visible in these views.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** Unhandled exceptions could lead to information disclosure (e.g., stack traces).
- **Recommendation:** Implement robust error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) for critical operations to catch unexpected errors and provide generic error messages to the user, logging the full details internally.

#### `apps/core/views.py`

##### Authentication and Authorization
- **Finding:** The `dashboard` view correctly checks `request.user.is_authenticated` and `IsProjectManager.has_permission(request.user)`. The `add_version` and `edit_version` views are protected by `@login_required` and `user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_staff)`.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** The authentication and authorization mechanisms appear to be correctly implemented for these views.
- **Recommendation:** N/A

##### File Operations
- **Finding:** The `add_version` and `edit_version` functions write to `docuhub/version.py` using `os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'docuhub', 'version.py')`.
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Details:** If `version.version_number` (which is user-controlled input via the form) could contain path traversal characters (e.g., `../`), it could lead to arbitrary file writes outside the intended directory.
- **Recommendation:** Implement strict validation on `version.version_number` to ensure it only contains safe characters (e.g., digits and dots) and does not contain any path traversal sequences. This is a critical vulnerability.

##### Information Disclosure
- **Finding:** The `current_version_api` endpoint provides details about the current version.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This information is generally not sensitive.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that no sensitive information is inadvertently added to the `Version` or `VersionImprovement` models in the future that could be exposed via this API.

##### Error Handling
- **Finding:** The `current_version_api` has a `try-except` block that catches generic `Exception` and returns a `JsonResponse` with an error message.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is good for preventing stack trace exposure.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that specific exceptions are caught where possible to provide more granular error handling and logging. The generic `Exception` catch is a good fallback.

#### `apps/accounts/utils.py`

##### Client IP Address Handling
- **Finding:** The `get_client_ip(request)` function retrieves the client IP from `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` and `REMOTE_ADDR`.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** It takes the first IP from `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` if present. This is a common pattern, but it can be vulnerable to IP spoofing if the application is behind a proxy that doesn't correctly set or strip `X-Forwarded-For` headers, or if the proxy is not trusted.
- **Recommendation:** If the application is deployed behind a trusted proxy, configure Django's `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` and `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` settings, and ensure that the proxy is configured to correctly set `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers. Additionally, consider using a library like `django-ipware` for more robust IP address detection, especially in complex proxy setups. If not behind a trusted proxy, `REMOTE_ADDR` is generally more reliable.

##### Input Validation
- **Finding:** `validate_employee_id` and `validate_phone_number` functions are present for basic format validation.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is a good practice.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that these validation rules are comprehensive enough for the application's requirements and that they are consistently applied wherever user input is accepted.

##### Error Handling
- **Finding:** The `log_user_action` function has a `try-except` block to prevent logging failures from breaking main functionality. The email sending functions also have `try-except` blocks.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is good, preventing critical failures due to external service issues.
- **Recommendation:** N/A

#### `apps/projects/api_views.py`

##### Authentication and Authorization
- **Finding:** `ProjectViewSet` and `DrawingViewSet` use `IsAuthenticated` and `ProjectOwnerPermission`. `submit_project_api` and `review_project_api` use `IsAuthenticated` and `ProjectManagerPermission`.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** `IsProjectManager.has_permission` is used for granular checks. This is a good approach for API security.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that `ProjectOwnerPermission` and `ProjectManagerPermission` are correctly implemented and thoroughly tested to prevent unauthorized access to project data or actions. Specifically, verify that `ProjectOwnerPermission` correctly restricts access to only the owner of the project or drawing, and `ProjectManagerPermission` correctly restricts access to project managers.

##### CSRF Protection
- **Finding:** `@csrf_protect` is used on API views that handle state-changing operations.
- **Severity:** Informational
- **Details:** This is a good practice for API endpoints that handle state-changing operations.
- **Recommendation:** Continue to ensure that all API endpoints handling state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) are protected by CSRF.

##### Rate Limiting
- **Finding:** Rate limiting (`throttle_classes`) is commented out for all API views.
- **Severity:** High
- **Details:** This leaves the application susceptible to brute-force attacks, DoS, and abuse.
- **Recommendation:** Re-enable and properly configure rate limiting for all API endpoints to protect against brute-force attacks, DoS, and abuse. This is critical for API security.

##### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Finding:** The `submit_project_api` and `review_project_api` views perform basic input validation.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Details:** (e.g., checking `project.status`, `project.drawings.filter(status='Active').exists()`, `action in ['approve', 'reject', 'revise']`, and `comments` presence). This is good.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure that all user-supplied input (e.g., `comments`, `action`) is properly validated and sanitized before being used in database queries or responses to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS if comments are rendered unsanitized in a UI).

##### Sensitive Data Exposure
- **Finding:** The API endpoints return serialized `Project` and `Drawing` objects.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** Ensure that the serializers (`ProjectSerializer`, `DrawingSerializer`) do not expose any sensitive fields that should not be accessible via the API.
- **Recommendation:** Review the `ProjectSerializer` and `DrawingSerializer` in `apps/projects/serializers.py` to ensure that only necessary and non-sensitive fields are exposed. Implement field-level permissions or custom serializers if certain fields need to be restricted based on user roles.

##### Client IP Address Handling
- **Finding:** The `get_client_ip(request)` function is used to retrieve the client's IP address for logging and audit purposes.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Details:** As noted in `apps/accounts/utils.py`, the implementation of this function needs to be reviewed for IP spoofing vulnerabilities.
- **Recommendation:** Refer to the recommendation for `get_client_ip` in `apps/accounts/utils.py`.

## Security Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate Actions (Within 24 Hours)
1.  **Upgrade all vulnerable dependencies:** Prioritize critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in Django, Django REST Framework, `mysql-connector-python`, Pillow, Redis, Requests, and Gunicorn.
2.  **Fix critical file write vulnerability:** Implement strict validation on `version.version_number` in `apps/core/views.py` to prevent path traversal.
3.  **Fix XSS vulnerabilities in `apps/projects/views.py`:** Properly escape user-controlled data embedded in JavaScript alerts.
4.  **Enable and properly configure rate limiting:** For all API endpoints and relevant views in `apps/projects/api_views.py` and `apps/projects/views.py`.

### Short-term Actions (Within 1 Week)
1.  **Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization:** Across all applications, especially where user-supplied input is processed and rendered.
2.  **Address password management in `apps/accounts/views.py`:** Consider implementing a secure, one-time link for password resets instead of sending temporary passwords via email.
3.  **Remove debug statements and implement proper logging:** Ensure no debug print statements are present in production code, especially in `apps/projects/views.py`.
4.  **Strengthen `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:** Ensure strict configuration in production to prevent broad access.
5.  **Review `get_client_ip` function:** In `apps/accounts/utils.py` for robust IP address detection, especially in proxy environments.

### Medium-term Actions (Within 1 Month)
1.  **Implement role-based access control throughout the application:** Ensure granular permissions are consistently applied and thoroughly tested.
2.  **Add comprehensive audit logging with data retention policies:** For all sensitive actions and data access.
3.  **Implement proper error handling without information disclosure:** Catch specific exceptions and provide generic error messages to users, logging full details internally.
4.  **Implement proper session management with timeouts:** And mechanisms to invalidate sessions upon logout, password change, or suspicious activity.
5.  **Review serializers for sensitive data exposure:** In `apps/projects/serializers.py` and other serializers to ensure only necessary and non-sensitive fields are exposed.
