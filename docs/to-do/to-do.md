### Todo List for Project Completion

#### High Priority (Bugs & Critical Fixes)

*   ~~**[Backend] Fix Duplicate View Function:** In `apps/projects/views.py`, the function `add_drawing` is defined twice, which will cause a runtime error. One of the definitions must be removed.~~ (FIXED)
*   ~~**[Backend] Fix `ProjectDetailView`:** In `apps/projects/views.py`, the `ProjectDetailView` class contains a duplicate `get()` method. The redundant method should be removed.~~ (FIXED)
*   ~~**[Backend] Implement `UserSession` Model:** In `apps/accounts/models.py`, the `UserSession` model is commented out. This feature needs to be fully implemented and integrated to enable user session tracking.~~ (FIXED)
*   ~~**[Backend] Enable Rate-Limiting Feature:** The `django-ratelimit` package is installed, but the `@ratelimit` decorators in the views are commented out. These should be enabled to protect the application in production.~~ (FIXED)

#### Medium Priority (Completeness & Functionality)

*   **[Frontend] Implement Frontend Testing:** The project lacks a testing framework for the frontend. Add `jest` and `React Testing Library` to the `frontend/package.json` dependencies and create tests for critical components, especially those related to the project submission and review flow. (BLOCKED - Environment Issue)
*   **[Frontend] Implement Comprehensive UI Feedback:**
    *   **Loading States:** Add loading indicators to pages and components (e.g., when submitting a project or fetching the project list) to improve user experience.
    *   **Error Handling:** Ensure that API errors (like permission denied or server errors) are caught and displayed to the user in a clear and helpful way. (IN PROGRESS - ProjectDetail.tsx, ProjectCreate.tsx, ProjectEdit.tsx updated)
*   ~~**[Backend] Enable API Throttling in Production:** In `apps/projects/api_views.py` and `views.py`, the throttling/rate-limiting configurations are commented out. These should be enabled to protect the application from abuse in a production environment.~~ (FIXED)
*   **[Documentation] Update `README.md`:** The main `Readme.md` is likely generic. It should be updated with project-specific setup instructions, an overview of the architecture, and guidelines for developers.

#### Low Priority (Code Quality & Refinements)

*   **[Frontend] Verify UI for All Project Statuses:** The `Project` model has 8 different statuses. Systematically review the frontend to ensure that each status is represented with a clear and distinct UI in all relevant views (dashboard, project list, project detail).
*   **[Backend] Refactor `history_log` View:** The `history_log` view in `apps/projects/views.py` is complex, combining two different history models and performing manual sorting in Python. This could be inefficient. Consider refactoring this logic, possibly by creating a unified history model or using a more efficient query strategy.
*   **[General] Review and Update All Documentation:** Review all files in the `docs/` directory to ensure they are up-to-date with the current state of the project.
*   **[Backend] Investigate Migration Inconsistency:** The `migrate` command reported "No migrations to apply" even after new migration files were generated. This could indicate a mismatch between the migration files and the `django_migrations` table in the database. This should be investigated to ensure migration state is healthy.

### Project Flow Completion Status

Based on my analysis, the core backend logic for the document flow is **mostly complete and well-designed**. The system correctly handles status changes, versioning, history logging, and email notifications in a robust way.

However, the project as a whole is **not yet complete** because there are several critical bugs and missing pieces that prevent the flow from functioning reliably and securely.

Hereâ€™s a summary of what's missing:

1.  **Critical Backend Bugs:** The application has duplicate function definitions in `apps/projects/views.py` for `add_drawing` and for the `get` method in `ProjectDetailView`. These will cause runtime errors and break the user-facing flow.
2.  **Incomplete User Experience:** The frontend is missing key features needed for a complete application:
    *   **No Frontend Tests:** There is no testing framework, which is a significant risk for a complex user interface.
    *   **No Loading/Error States:** The UI likely feels unresponsive or breaks ungracefully when waiting for the server or when errors occur.
3.  **Missing Production Safeguards:** Features like API rate-limiting are defined but have been disabled. These are essential for security and stability in a live environment.
4.  **Unfinished Backend Features:** The `UserSession` model for tracking user activity is defined in the code but is not actually active.

In short, while the blueprint for the flow is there, the project needs the fixes and features outlined in the `docs/to-do.md` file to be considered truly complete and ready for production.
