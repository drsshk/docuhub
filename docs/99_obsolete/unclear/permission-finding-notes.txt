The `apps/projects/views.py` file contains several views, and permissions are handled using a combination of `LoginRequiredMixin` and custom permission checks.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **`LoginRequiredMixin`**: Most views, such as `ProjectListView`, `ProjectDetailView`, `ProjectCreateView`, `ProjectUpdateView`, `DrawingCreateView`, `DrawingUpdateView`, `DrawingDetailView`, `ProjectReviewView`, `ProjectHistoryLogView`, `ProjectRecoverView`, and `ProjectRestoreView`, inherit from `LoginRequiredMixin`. This ensures that only authenticated users can access these views.

*   **Custom Permission Checks**:
    *   **`ProjectCreateView`**: The `form_valid` method checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`. This implies that only superusers can create projects.
    *   **`ProjectUpdateView`**: The `get_queryset` method filters projects based on `is_active=True` and `is_deleted=False`. The `form_valid` method also checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`.
    *   **`DrawingCreateView`**: The `form_valid` method checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`.
    *   **`DrawingUpdateView`**: The `get_queryset` method filters drawings based on `is_active=True` and `is_deleted=False`. The `form_valid` method also checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`.
    *   **`ProjectReviewView`**: The `get_queryset` method filters projects based on `is_active=True` and `is_deleted=False`. The `form_valid` method checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`.
    *   **`ProjectHistoryLogView`**: The `get_queryset` method filters projects based on `is_active=True` and `is_deleted=False`.
    *   **`ProjectRecoverView`**: The `get_queryset` method filters projects based on `is_deleted=True`. The `form_valid` method checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`.
    *   **`ProjectRestoreView`**: The `get_queryset` method filters projects based on `is_deleted=True`. The `form_valid` method checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`.
    *   **`AdminPendingProjectsView`**: This view is specifically for superusers, as indicated by its name and likely usage.
    *   **`ProjectDeleteView`**: The `form_valid` method checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`.
    *   **`DrawingDeleteView`**: The `form_valid` method checks `if not self.request.user.is_superuser:`.

In summary, while `LoginRequiredMixin` ensures authentication, many critical actions like creating, updating, reviewing, recovering, restoring, and deleting projects and drawings are restricted to superusers through explicit `is_superuser` checks within the view logic. This suggests a highly centralized control over project management by administrators.

### Recommendation for View Permissions:

To enhance flexibility and scalability, consider implementing a more granular permission system instead of relying solely on `is_superuser` checks for all critical actions. This could involve:

1.  **Django's built-in permission system**: Define custom permissions (e.g., `can_create_project`, `can_review_project`, `can_delete_drawing`) and assign them to specific user roles or groups.
    *   **Details**: You can define custom permissions in the `Meta` class of your models (e.g., `apps/projects/models.py`). For example:
        ```python
        class Project(models.Model):
            # ... fields ...
            class Meta:
                permissions = [
                    ("can_create_project", "Can create project"),
                    ("can_review_project", "Can review project"),
                    ("can_delete_project", "Can delete project"),
                ]
        ```
        After defining, run `makemigrations` and `migrate`. You can then assign these permissions to users or groups in the Django admin. In your views, you can use `user.has_perm('app_label.permission_codename')` to check for permissions. For class-based views, `PermissionRequiredMixin` can be used.

2.  **Custom permission classes**: Create custom permission classes that inherit from `BasePermission` (if using Django REST Framework) or `UserPassesTestMixin` (for function-based views) to implement more complex permission logic based on user roles, project ownership, or other criteria.
    *   **Details**: For function-based views, `UserPassesTestMixin` is useful. You can define a `test_func` method that returns `True` if the user has permission, `False` otherwise. For example:
        ```python
        from django.contrib.auth.mixins import UserPassesTestMixin
        from django.views.generic import CreateView

        class ProjectCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin, CreateView):
            # ...
            def test_func(self):
                return self.request.user.has_perm('projects.can_create_project')
            # ...
        ```
        If you were using Django REST Framework for APIs, you would create classes inheriting from `rest_framework.permissions.BasePermission`.

3.  **Object-level permissions**: For actions like updating or deleting a specific project or drawing, implement object-level permissions to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., project owners, assigned reviewers) can perform these actions.
    *   **Details**: Libraries like `django-guardian` or `django-rules` can provide robust object-level permission management. Without external libraries, you would typically implement this logic directly in your `get_queryset` or `dispatch` methods within your views. For example, to allow only the project owner to update a project:
        ```python
        class ProjectUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
            # ...
            def get_queryset(self):
                queryset = super().get_queryset()
                if not self.request.user.is_superuser:
                    queryset = queryset.filter(owner=self.request.user)
                return queryset
            # ...
        ```
        This would need to be combined with checks for other roles (e.g., reviewers) if they also have update permissions.

4.  **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Define distinct roles (e.g., Project Manager, Reviewer, Contributor) with specific sets of permissions, and assign users to these roles. This allows for easier management of user privileges as the application grows.
    *   **Details**: You can implement RBAC by creating a `Role` model (if not already present in `apps/accounts/models.py`) and linking it to your `User` model. Each `Role` can then be associated with a set of Django permissions. Users would be assigned one or more roles. This allows you to manage permissions at a higher level of abstraction (roles) rather than assigning individual permissions to each user. For example, a `ProjectManager` role could have `can_create_project`, `can_review_project`, and `can_delete_project` permissions.

By adopting a more granular permission system, the application can better support diverse user roles and responsibilities, reduce the need for direct `is_superuser` checks in view logic, and improve overall security and maintainability.
