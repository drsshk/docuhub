# Project Ownership Transfer Implementation Plan

## Overview
DocuHub currently lacks the ability to transfer project ownership between users. This document outlines a comprehensive plan to implement secure ownership transfer functionality while maintaining data integrity and audit trails.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Ownership Model
- **Project Ownership**: `submitted_by` field (immutable)
- **Drawing Ownership**: `added_by` field (immutable)
- **Permission System**: Ownership-based access control with Role model
- **User Roles**: Admin, Approver, Submitter, Viewer (via UserProfile.role)
- **Admin Capabilities**: Can view/manage but cannot transfer ownership

### Business Requirements
- Employee departure scenarios (Admin-managed)
- Project reassignment between team members (Admin-managed)
- Administrative project management
- Bulk ownership operations (Admin-only)
- Complete audit trail

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Database Schema Changes
```python
# New model for ownership transfer history
class OwnershipTransfer(models.Model):
    project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    previous_owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.PROTECT, related_name='transferred_from')
    new_owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.PROTECT, related_name='transferred_to')
    transferred_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.PROTECT, related_name='transfers_performed')
    transfer_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    reason = models.TextField(blank=True)
    metadata = models.JSONField(default=dict, blank=True)
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-transfer_date']
```

#### 1.2 Enhanced ApprovalHistory
```python
# Add to ACTION_CHOICES in ApprovalHistory
('Ownership_Transferred', 'Ownership Transferred'),
```

### Phase 2: Service Layer

#### 2.1 ProjectOwnershipService
```python
class ProjectOwnershipService:
    @transaction.atomic
    def transfer_ownership(self, project: Project, new_owner: User, 
                          admin: User, reason: str = "", 
                          request_meta: Optional[Dict] = None) -> bool:
        """
        Transfer project ownership with validation and audit trail
        
        Args:
            project: Project to transfer
            new_owner: User to receive ownership
            admin: Admin performing the transfer
            reason: Reason for transfer
            request_meta: Additional metadata (IP, user agent, etc.)
            
        Returns:
            bool: Success status
            
        Raises:
            ValidationError: If transfer conditions not met
            PermissionDenied: If admin lacks permission
        """
        
    def bulk_transfer_ownership(self, projects: QuerySet, new_owner: User,
                               admin: User, reason: str = "") -> Dict:
        """Bulk transfer multiple projects"""
        
    def get_transfer_history(self, project: Project) -> QuerySet:
        """Get ownership transfer history for project"""
```

#### 2.2 Validation Rules
- New owner must be active user with role: Submitter, Approver, or Admin
- Only Admin role can perform ownership transfers
- Project must be in transferable state
- Cannot transfer to current owner
- Reason required for administrative transfers
- Viewers cannot own or transfer projects

### Phase 3: Permissions and Security

#### 3.1 New Permission Classes
```python
class CanTransferOwnership:
    @staticmethod
    def has_permission(user: User, project: Project = None) -> bool:
        """Only Admin role users can transfer ownership"""
        if not user.is_active or not user.profile.role:
            return False
        return user.profile.role.name == 'Admin'

class CanReceiveOwnership:
    @staticmethod
    def has_permission(user: User) -> bool:
        """User must be active and have appropriate role"""
        if not user.is_active or not user.profile.role:
            return False
        
        # Only Submitters, Approvers, and Admins can own projects
        return user.profile.role.name in ['Submitter', 'Approver', 'Admin']
```

#### 3.2 Updated Existing Permissions
- Modify `CanEditProject` to handle ownership changes
- Update `CanCreateNewVersion` for transferred projects
- Ensure proper cascade for related drawings

### Phase 4: User Interface

#### 4.1 Admin Interface Enhancements
```python
# Enhanced ProjectAdmin
class ProjectAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    actions = ['transfer_ownership', 'bulk_transfer_ownership']
    
    def transfer_ownership(self, request, queryset):
        """Admin action for ownership transfer"""
        
    def bulk_transfer_ownership(self, request, queryset):
        """Bulk ownership transfer action"""
```

#### 4.2 Web Interface Forms
```python
class OwnershipTransferForm(forms.Form):
    new_owner = forms.ModelChoiceField(
        queryset=User.objects.filter(
            is_active=True,
            profile__role__name__in=['Submitter', 'Approver', 'Admin']
        )
    )
    reason = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea, required=True)
    confirm_transfer = forms.BooleanField(required=True)
    
    def clean_new_owner(self):
        """Validate new owner eligibility"""
        user = self.cleaned_data.get('new_owner')
        if not user.profile.role or user.profile.role.name not in ['Submitter', 'Approver', 'Admin']:
            raise forms.ValidationError("User must have Submitter, Approver, or Admin role to own projects.")
        return user
```

#### 4.3 Templates
- `transfer_ownership.html` - Single project transfer
- `bulk_transfer.html` - Multiple project transfer
- `ownership_history.html` - Transfer history display

### Phase 5: API Enhancements

#### 5.1 New API Endpoints
```python
# apps/projects/api_urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    path('projects/<uuid:pk>/transfer-ownership/', 
         api_views.TransferOwnershipAPIView.as_view(), 
         name='api-transfer-ownership'),
    path('projects/bulk-transfer/', 
         api_views.BulkTransferOwnershipAPIView.as_view(), 
         name='api-bulk-transfer'),
    path('projects/<uuid:pk>/ownership-history/', 
         api_views.OwnershipHistoryAPIView.as_view(), 
         name='api-ownership-history'),
]
```

#### 5.2 API Serializers
```python
class OwnershipTransferSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    new_owner_id = serializers.UUIDField()
    reason = serializers.CharField(max_length=1000)
    
class OwnershipHistorySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = OwnershipTransfer
        fields = '__all__'
```

### Phase 6: Notifications and Audit

#### 6.1 Email Notifications
- Notify previous owner of transfer
- Notify new owner of received ownership
- Admin notification for transfer confirmation

#### 6.2 Enhanced Logging
```python
# Log all ownership changes
logger.info(f"Ownership transferred: Project {project.id} from {old_owner} to {new_owner} by {admin}")
```

#### 6.3 System Checks
- Data integrity validation
- Orphaned project detection
- Permission consistency checks
